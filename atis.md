# ATIS

Automatic terminal information service, or ATIS, is a continuous broadcast of recorded aeronautical information in busier terminal areas, i.e. airports and their immediate surroundings. ATIS broadcasts contain essential information, such as current weather information, active runways, available approaches, and any other information required by the pilots, such as important NOTAMs. Pilots usually listen to an available ATIS broadcast before contacting the local control unit, which reduces the controllers' workload and relieves frequency congestion.


1) Tune into ATIS (look into server info) for active runway information
2) First radio transmission just before the runway
3) Radio comms: Who are you talking to? Who are you? What do you want?
4) Takeoff: "Anapa Traffic, Hentai 3-4 taking the active runway 04 for an east departure, Anapa Traffic"
5) Curtesy 1: Repeat "Who are you talking" to at the end. 
6) Curtesy 2: Once 10 miles away from airfield announce leaving airspace, "Anapa Traffic, Last call for Hentai 3-4, Anapa Traffic".
7) Curtesy 3: After tuning into freq, first listen for possible conversations before talking
8) Traffic patterns: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Airport_traffic_pattern.jpg
9) Change QFE depending on airfield you want to land on
10) "Downwind" means "left downwind". Say "right downwind" when taking the right downwind.
11) Land approach: "Anapa Traffic, Hentai 3-4 entering an overhead break for runway 04, approaching from the south, Anapa Traffic"
12) On downwind: "Anapa Traffic, Hentai 3-4 is downwind for runway 04, Anapa Traffic"
13) On base: "Anapa Traffic, Hentai 3-4 is on (left) base for runway 04, Anapa Traffic"
14) On final: "Anapa Traffic, Hentai 3-4 is on (short) final for runway 04, Anapa Traffic"
15) Crossing runway: "Anapa Traffic, Hentai 3-4 crossing runway 04, Anapa Traffic"
16) After landing and clearing the runway: "Anapa Traffic, Hentai 3-4 clear of the active, Anapa Traffic"
